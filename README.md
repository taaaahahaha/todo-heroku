# Todo-Heroku

A web-application based on clearing basic concepts related to flask, building API's, performing CRUD operations using Flask and Mongodb.

I added an extra layer of authentication for every individual user whoever wishes to use the application. 

Heroku is a free hosting utility and hence sometimes the [Project URL](https://todo-taaha.herokuapp.com/) might come up with an Internal Server Error. Just refresh or render the link again and it should work fine.
